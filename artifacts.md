This page provides a list of the FHIR artifacts defined as part of this implementation guide.

### Structures: Resource Profiles 

These define constraints on FHIR resources for systems conforming to this implementation guide.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Age at Stroke Onset Observation Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-age-at-onset-observation-profile.md) | Profile specifically for recording the patient's age at stroke onset. |
| [Base Profile for Stroke-Related Observations](StructureDefinition-base-stroke-observation.md) | Constraints for observations recorded in the context of stroke care. |
| [Discharge Medication Request Profile](StructureDefinition-discharge-medication-request-profile.md) | Represents a medication prescription made as part of the patient's discharge plan, categorized as community administration. |
| [Patient with SNOMED Gender and Age (extensions)](StructureDefinition-patient-age-gender-snomed-profile.md) | Profile that adds an integer age extension and a SNOMED-based gender extension. |
| [Prior Medication Statement Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-prior-medication-statement-profile.md) | Represents a statement about the patient's medication use**before**the index event. |
| [Specific Stroke Finding Observation Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-specific-finding-observation-profile.md) | Profile for specific coded findings like Afib/Flutter status or mTICI score. |
| [Stroke Brain Imaging Procedure Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-stroke-brain-imaging-procedure-profile.md) | Procedure profile to record key stroke procedures, including status, timing, complications, reasons, and context. |
| [Stroke Carotid Imaging Procedure Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-stroke-carotid-imaging-procedure-profile.md) | Procedure profile to record key stroke procedures, including status, timing, complications, reasons, and context. |
| [Stroke Circumstance Observation Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-stroke-circumstance-observation-profile.md) | Profile for recording findings about stroke onset circumstances (In-hospital, Wake-up). |
| [Stroke Diagnosis Condition Profile](StructureDefinition-stroke-diagnosis-condition-profile.md) | Defines a Condition profile constrained to represent the definitive diagnosis of the current stroke event during the indexed encounter. The profile fixes category to encounter-diagnosis, binds code (required) to StrokeDiagnosisVS, and prohibits onset[x] to avoid ambiguity with symptom-onset capture via dedicated extensions. Use this profile for final/confirmed stroke diagnoses recorded at discharge or after diagnostic workup; do not use it for history-of conditions, screening findings, or provisional ‘rule-out’ statements. Optional extensions capture hemorrhagic bleeding reason, ischemic etiology, and structured onset date/time when clinically known. |
| [Stroke Encounter Profile](StructureDefinition-stroke-encounter-profile.md) | Profile for an Encounter resource representing a patient's hospital admission and stay for a stroke event, including key administrative and workflow details. |
| [Stroke Functional Score Observation Profile (R5, Timing Ext)](StructureDefinition-functional-score-observation-profile.md) | Profile for recording functional scores (mRS, NIHSS), using an extension for timing context. |
| [Stroke Registry Organization Profile](StructureDefinition-stroke-registry-organization-profile.md) | Organization profile ensuring an active organization with a registry identifier (system=https://stroke.qualityregistry.org) and a required name, aligned with the build_organization() transformation. |
| [Stroke Risk Factor Condition Profile](StructureDefinition-stroke-risk-factor-condition-profile.md) | Defines a Condition profile for pre-existing or concurrent conditions that increase stroke risk (e.g., atrial fibrillation/flutter, diabetes, hypertension, coronary disease). The profile fixes category to problem-list-item, binds code (required) to StrokeRiskFactorVS, and supports onset[x] and recordedDate to document chronology and longitudinal tracking. Use this profile to maintain the problem list and to support risk assessment and CDS; do not use it to code the acute stroke event itself. |
| [Stroke Swallow Procedure Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-stroke-swallow-procedure-profile.md) | Procedure profile to record key stroke procedures, including status, timing, complications, reasons, and context. |
| [Stroke Thrombolysis Procedure Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-stroke-mechanical-procedure-profile.md) | Procedure profile to record key stroke procedures, including status, timing, complications, reasons, and context. |
| [Stroke Timing Metric Observation Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-timing-metric-observation-profile.md) | Profile for recording key process timing metrics (D2N, D2G). |
| [Stroke Vital Sign Observation Profile (R5)](StructureDefinition-vital-sign-observation-profile.md) | Profile for recording key vital signs (Systolic/Diastolic BP) in stroke patients. |
