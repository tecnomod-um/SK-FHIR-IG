# Examples

Below you’ll find practical examples that illustrate how the IG profiles are used in real scenarios.  
Each example is organized under its corresponding profile to make navigation and reuse easier.

- **Purpose:** demonstrate valid instances that conform to the profiles in this guide.  
- **How to use them:** inspect the JSON/XML to understand required vs. optional elements, bindings, and invariants.  
- **Reusability:** you can copy these instances as templates and adapt the data to your context.  
- **Validation:** we recommend validating modified examples with the IG Publisher to ensure conformance.

> 💡 Tip: If you’re new to the guide, start by opening a profile you care about and then review its related examples here to see the profile “in action”.
