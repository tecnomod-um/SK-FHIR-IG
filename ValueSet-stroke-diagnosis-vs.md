SNOMED CT concepts representing final stroke-related diagnoses intended for use in Condition.code (and similar elements) within this IG. The scope covers ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This value set is designed to support consistent capture, validation, analytics, and decision support. Implementers should expand against a terminology server using the appropriate SNOMED CT edition/version and preferred language(s) for display. Localizations or national derivatives MAY provide additional designations without altering the canonical definition. This value set is not intended for history-of, screening, or procedural concepts. 

 
To provide a consistent set of SNOMED CT concepts for coding definitive stroke-related diagnoses in this IG.

 Explanation of the columns that may appear on this page: 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| Level | A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level. In this scheme, some codes are under other codes, and imply that the code they are under also applies |
| System | The source of the definition of the code (when the value set draws in codes defined elsewhere) |
| Code | The code (used as the code in the resource instance) |
| Display | The display (used in the*display*element of a[Coding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/datatypes.html#Coding)). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application |
| Definition | An explanation of the meaning of the concept |
| Comments | Additional notes about how to use the code |
