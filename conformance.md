## Conformance

This section describes how implementers can claim conformance to the **RES-Q Stroke Registry Implementation Guide (IG)** and what requirements apply to servers and clients.

### Scope

This IG defines:

* **Profiles** on core FHIR R5 resources (e.g., Encounter, Observation, Procedure, Condition, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement).
* **Terminology artifacts** (ValueSets and CodeSystems) that bind to profile elements.
* **Extensions** to capture stroke-specific data not covered by the base resources.
* **Examples** illustrating compliant data instances.

### Claiming Conformance

An implementation **conforms** to this IG if it:

1. Supports the**Must Support**data elements on each relevant profile.
1. Uses the**required**/appropriate**terminology bindings**(e.g., Required, Extensible).
1. Satisfies**cardinality**and**invariants**defined in the profiles.
1. Implements applicable**search parameters**and**operations**(if defined for your use case).
1. Satisfies any defined**CapabilityStatement**requirements (server/client).

### Must Support

* **Definition:** If an element is marked **Must Support**, systems **SHALL** be able to **send, receive, and persist** the element when it is relevant and present in the source data.
* **Empty Data:** If a Must Support element is unknown or not present, systems SHALL follow the guidance in **Data Absent/Unknown** (see **Guidance** page).
* **Choice Types:** When multiple data types are allowed, at least one SHALL be supported as documented in the profile narrative.

### Cardinality & Invariants

* **Cardinality** is authoritative; elements SHALL satisfy the minimum/maximum occurrences.
* **Invariants** (FHIRPath) are **required** constraints; validation SHALL fail if violated (e.g., “if status = `not-done` then `statusReason` must exist”).

### Terminology Binding Strength

* **Required:** Only concepts from the bound value set are allowed.
* **Extensible:** Prefer concepts from the value set; other concepts are allowed **only** if a suitable match is not available.
* **Preferred / Example:** Use is recommended, but not enforced.

### Server Requirements

If a **server** claims conformance:

* It SHALL publish a **CapabilityStatement** (or declare conformance via the one provided by this IG, if defined).
* It SHALL advertise supported **profiles** (`StructureDefinition.url`) for each resource type it exposes.
* It SHOULD support **_include**, **_revinclude**, and common search params for clinical exchange (e.g., `subject`, `encounter`, `date`, `code`), when relevant to the profile.

### Client Requirements

If a **client** claims conformance:

* It SHALL be capable of producing/consuming resources that **validate** against the profiles it claims to support.
* It SHALL be able to process **Must Support** elements and required **terminology bindings**.

### Security and Privacy (Informative)

* Follow local privacy law and institutional policy for PHI/PII.
* Use TLS for transport (HTTPS).
* Consider OAuth2/SMART-on-FHIR (or equivalent) for authorization in interactive workflows.
